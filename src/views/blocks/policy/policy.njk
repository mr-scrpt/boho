				<p>We understand that Your privacy is important to You and that You care about how Your personal data is used and shared
online. We respect and value the privacy of everyone who visits Our Site and will only collect and use personal data in
ways that are described here, and in a manner that is consistent with Our obligations and Your rights under the law.</p>

				<p>Under the EU Regulation 2016/679 – the General Data Protection Regulation and other applicable legislation, We are
required to comply with personal data protection and processing procedures to ensure that Your data is at all times
stored and processed securely and that Your rights as a data subject are observed and protected. We take these
obligations very seriously and have implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure protection of
Your privacy.</p>

				<p>What is personal data?</p>

				<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) defines personal data as:</p>
				<p>“any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural
person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name,
an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical,
physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”
You, as the Company’s Affiliate, provided that you are a natural person, are the ‘data subject’ in relation to this
Affiliate Privacy Policy. In short, this means that any personal data relating to you as a data subject is protected
under data protection law. However, it does not include data where the identifiers relating to the data subject have
been removed (meaning anonymous data).</p>

				<p>Registration</p>
				<p>In order to use our site, you must first complete the registration form. When you register we collect personal

complete the registration process. You are encouraged to provide the additional, optional information specified on the
registration form so we can provide you with a more personalized relationship.</p>

				<p>Site and Services Updates</p>
				<p>We also send you site and services announcement updates. You are not able to un-subscribe from these because they
contain important information about our site and our services.</p>

				<p>Surveys & Contests</p>
				<p>From time-to-time we request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is
completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose any information to us. Information

in these areas becomes public information. You should therefore exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal
information.</p>

				<p>Security</p>
				<p>We take every precaution to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of all information under our control. When you
submit sensitive information via our site, your information is protected both online and off-line. While we use
encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information
off-line. The servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. If you have
any questions about the security at our site, you can send an email to marketing@bohoaffiliates.com</p>

				<p>Supplementation of Information</p>

password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on our clients, services and a
newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, our users have the option not receive these types of
communications (refer to our choice and opt-out section below).</p>

instructions in the relevant email.</p>

				<p>Notification of Changes</p>
				<p>If we decide to change our privacy statement, we will post those changes on our Homepage and in our newsletter so you<
are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If
we change the way we use your Personally Identifiable Information we will notify you by email in our newsletter. If you
would like to opt out of having your information used in this new manner, we will ask you to contact us within a month
and your information will not be used. If you do not contact us within that month, we will assume that you consent to
have your information used in this new manner./p>
